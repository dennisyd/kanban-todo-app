## 📊 Technical Highlights

### Key Decisions & Tradeoffs

#### 1. Position Management
**Decision**: Integer positions with gaps (0, 1000, 2000...)

**Pros**:
- Simple to understand and implement
- Can insert between items without reindexing all
- Easy to debug

**Cons**:
- May need occasional rebalancing
- Uses more storage than fractional indexing

**Rationale**: Simplicity and ease of implementation outweigh slight inefficiency. Rebalancing logic is included but rarely needed.

#### 2. Realtime Architecture
**Decision**: Subscribe at board level, not globally

**Pros**:
- Minimal data transfer
- Only receives relevant updates
- Better performance with many users

**Cons**:
- Multiple subscriptions if viewing multiple boards
- Slightly more complex setup

**Rationale**: Users typically work on one board at a time. Board-level subscriptions scale better.

#### 3. Optimistic Updates
**Decision**: Update UI immediately, rollback on error

**Pros**:
- Instant user feedback
- Feels responsive even on slow connections
- Reduces perceived latency

**Cons**:
- More complex state management
- Potential for inconsistency if error handling is poor

**Rationale**: Modern apps require instant feedback. Rollback strategy handles errors gracefully.

#### 4. Auth Strategy
**Decision**: GitHub OAuth only (no email/password)

**Pros**:
- No password management complexity
- Leverages existing GitHub accounts
- Professional appearance

**Cons**:
- Requires GitHub account
- Extra OAuth setup step

**Rationale**: Target audience (developers) all have GitHub. Shows integration skills.
